                                EASA Air Operations Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 Part-NCC applies to non-commercial
                                flights in complex motor-powered aircraft. Part-NCC requires the operator to adhere to
                                the same essential requirements as commercial air transport operators, but the rules are
                                proportionate - instead of holding an AOC, the operator submits a declaration to the
                                competent Authority regarding the proposed operation.
                                <br><br>
                                The declaration establishes and maintains the required oversight programme for Part-NCC
                                aircraft. The programme is developed based on the nature and complexity of each
                                operation using available data. Part NCC operations will be achieved via our Irish team
                                and is under the approval of the IAA. All our current team members hold similar post
                                holding positions within the Alliance AOC (and other AOCs).

                                Aviation contributes around 2% of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon
                                offsetting allows individuals and businesses to neutralise these emissions and reduce
                                their environmental impact. A passenger’s carbon offsetting contribution goes into
                                purchasing independently verified carbon offsets, and this supports environmental
                                projects that remove greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere or prevent future
                                emissions from occurring.
                                <br><br>
                                Developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) the Carbon Offsetting
                                and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is a carbon reduction and
                                carbon offset programme to lower CO2 emissions for international flights and reduce
                                aviation’s impact on climate change.

                                Alliance are a major stakeholder in a non-profit company GSE Energies.
                                (gseenergies.aero). Through GSE Energies we calculate the emissions for each Alliance
                                flight, and our passengers can voluntarily offset their share of these emissions. The
                                emissions for each flight are calculated on a per-passenger basis. Once a passenger has
                                offset their flight, the equivalent number of carbon offsets will be purchased and
                                retired in order to balance out their share of the flight’s emissions. GSE Energies also
                                focuses on the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and is wholly committed to
                                a de-carbonised aviation industry.
